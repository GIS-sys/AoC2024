# Advent of code 2024

This repository contains solutions to the [Advent of Code competition](https://adventofcode.com/2024). The goal is to write clear and efficient code, ensuring that every program runs fast (under 1 second)

# Testing

For easy testing put all your inputs inside of the directory `check/inputs/` in corresponding files. For example, put input from day 10 to the file `check/inputs/10`. Then run
```bash
check/run.sh 00
```
to run all the tasks with your inputs. Make sure every input file ends with a new line!
